The game doesn’t save your data- because it’s designed for you to play it and try to reach X amount of gems in the shortest time.
The images didn’t load on the github pages site, and the other pages usch as the Resources tab. It works now though and I think it was because of one single ”/“.</p> <h2>Changes</h2> <p>The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the site:</p> <ul><li>Soy Clicker has been fixed</li> <li>More thinngs added to the Extras tab</li> <li>New images in the Resources tab</li> <li>Added Herobrine</li></ul> <h2>Features</h2> <ul><li>🖱️ Clicker Game</li> <li>🔒 Security Tips</li> <li>⬇️ Download Links</li> <li>✅ Reviews</li></ul> <h2>Upcoming Changes & Additions</h2> <ul><li>📹 Poster <hr> <br></li></ul>`,1);function F(e){var t=$();h(18),r(e,t)}const O=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:F,metadata:g},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),f={title:"Version 0.1",date:"2025-04-12"},{title:te,date:ae}=f;var N=n("<h1>Prose, “fsevents”, and Tim Apple’s curse</h1> <h2>why!!</h2> <p>It was pretty easy to come up with an idea for a project but its of course much harder to put that into reality, and during the creation of this website i have had to restart my progress from scratch close to about 15-20 times because of minimal errors that were made in the foundation that eventually made the whole thing cave in.</p> <p>On this reset I have made sure to make backups so that I wont ever have to start from scratch again, and I have not ran into any similar issues yet.</p> <p>First it was the “fsevents” error, that I still dont know the reason for or the solution to, but after a hard reset and complete reinstall of packages and all my dependencies, its a classic case of redoing something and doing it the long, right way. The devblog was done earlier but because of all the website errors I had absolutely no way to fit it into the deadline of the 9th. 4/11 was the first day I could even push my website. In the devblog I ran into many issues, such as the ‘prose’ issue, where formatting is completely broken unless you add in a ‘prose’ class to the article tag in the +page.svelte file in the slug directory of the project, and also having to add a ‘export const prerender = true’ to the +page.server.js file to make accessing te blog posts even possible.</p> <h2>Changes</h2> <p>The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the site:</p> <ul><li>1337XS now has a permanent member of the team, Jinky Tahooga.</li> <li>A barebones stylization of all of the pages, which will be updated as the site goes on.</li> <li>Fixed a SvelteKit compatible version of FontAwesome.</li> <li>Fixed the devblog, as you can see.</li> <li>Removed Herobrine</li></ul> <p>To get a better view on the changes proposed in that first version it is easier to watch the tutorial, it gives you a much better insight into what I started with.</p> <h2>Features</h2> <p>😴 Not much.. yet..</p> <h2>Upcoming Changes & Additions</h2> <ul><li>JinkyNews (no not kinkynews or ninkyjews) okay maybe itll be called TahoogaNews but something like that <hr> <br></li></ul>",1);function z(e){var t=N();h(24),r(e,t)}const P=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:z,metadata:f},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),b={title:"Version 0.2",date:"2025-04-18"},{title:oe,date:ie}=b;var R=n(`<h1>FAQ’s, Tahoogas, and Errors</h1> <h2>who!!</h2> <p>Now that I had my barebones website it’s not as difficult to map out what I want to do or where to start, so that’s a relief in a way. I’m working on fixing the simple pages first, such as the About page and the FAQ page. Next after that will probably be the resources/security page, since thats not too bad either. Lastly I’m pretty sure im gonna do the clicker because thats gonna take the most work.

There are some ideas, such as a popup menu for the ‘learn more’ button that I wanted to add, but that I just simply didnt have the time to do. That’s alright though, and I’ve still done more than what I originally planned for so I’m glad for that.
I started on the clicker game, and have added quite a bit of features to it already.
