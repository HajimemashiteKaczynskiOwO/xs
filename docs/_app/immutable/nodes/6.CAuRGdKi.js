The devblog was done earlier but because of all the website errors I had absolutely no way to fit it into the deadline of the 9th. 4/11 was the first day I could even push my website. In the devblog I ran into many issues, such as the ‚Äòprose‚Äô issue, where formatting is completely broken unless you add in a ‚Äòprose‚Äô class to the article tag in the +page.svelte file in the slug directory of the project, and also having to add a ‚Äòexport const prerender = true‚Äô to the +page.server.js file to make accessing te blog posts even possible.</p> <h2>Changes</h2> <p>The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the site:</p> <ul><li>1337XS now has a permanent member of the team, Jinky Tahooga.</li> <li>A barebones stylization of all of the pages, which will be updated as the site goes on.</li> <li>Fixed a SvelteKit compatible version of FontAwesome.</li> <li>Fixed the devblog, as you can see.</li> <li>Removed Herobrine</li></ul> <p>To get a better view on the changes proposed in that first version it is easier to watch the tutorial, it gives you a much better insight into what I started with.</p> <h2>Features</h2> <p>üò¥ Not much.. yet..</p> <h2>Upcoming Changes & Additions</h2> <ul><li>JinkyNews (no not kinkynews or ninkyjews) okay maybe itll be called TahoogaNews but something like that <hr> <br></li></ul>",1);function O(e){var t=F();p(24),l(e,t)}const $=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:O,metadata:g},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),f={title:"Version 0.2",date:"2025-04-18"},{title:W,date:Y}=f;var C=r(`<h1>FAQ‚Äôs, Tahoogas, and Errors</h1> <h2>who!!</h2> <p>Now that I had my barebones website it‚Äôs not as difficult to map out what I want to do or where to start, so that‚Äôs a relief in a way. I‚Äôm working on fixing the simple pages first, such as the About page and the FAQ page. Next after that will probably be the resources/security page, since thats not too bad either. Lastly I‚Äôm pretty sure im gonna do the clicker because thats gonna take the most work.

That‚Äôs alright though, and I‚Äôve still done more than what I originally planned for so I‚Äôm glad for that.
I started on the clicker game, and have added quite a bit of features to it already.
