If you search up "best vpns" online you're just going to get the articles bought & paid for by those same VPN companies, who hog your data, engulf themself in your money, and provide a shit service. That is why I've picked Mullvad VPN as my top candidate to recommend. It's fairly priced at 5€ a month, and you can pay for it using crypto, real cash, credit card, any basically any other form of payment that you can imagine.</h2></div> <div class="cards svelte-1dtxpvv" style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; flex-wrap: nowrap; margin:auto; justify-content:center;"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-rows-2 lg:grid-rows-3 gap-8 p-8 margin:auto; svelte-1dtxpvv"></div></div> <div class="sub-title svelte-1dtxpvv"><h2 class="svelte-1dtxpvv">Thanks for reading!</h2></div>`,1);function V(r){const n=[{title:"Mullvad VPN",description:"From the heart of Sweden comes MullvadVPN.
