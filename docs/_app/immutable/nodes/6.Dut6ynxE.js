The devblog was done earlier but because of all the website errors I had absolutely no way to fit it into the deadline of the 9th. 4/11 was the first day I could even push my website. In the devblog I ran into many issues, such as the ‚Äòprose‚Äô issue, where formatting is completely broken unless you add in a ‚Äòprose‚Äô class to the article tag in the +page.svelte file in the slug directory of the project, and also having to add a ‚Äòexport const prerender = true‚Äô to the +page.server.js file to make accessing te blog posts even possible.</p> <h2>Changes</h2> <p>The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the site:</p> <ul><li>1337XS now has a permanent member of the team, Jinky Tahooga.</li> <li>A barebones stylization of all of the pages, which will be updated as the site goes on.</li> <li>Fixed a SvelteKit compatible version of FontAwesome.</li> <li>Fixed the devblog, as you can see.</li> <li>Removed Herobrine</li></ul> <p>To get a better view on the changes proposed in that first version it is easier to watch the tutorial, it gives you a much better insight into what I started with.</p> <h2>Features</h2> <p>üò¥ Not much.. yet..</p> <h2>Upcoming Changes & Additions</h2> <ul><li>JinkyNews (no not kinkynews or ninkyjews) okay maybe itll be called TahoogaNews but something like that <hr> <br></li></ul>",1);function A(e){var t=T();m(24),d(e,t)}const F=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:A,metadata:g},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),f={title:"Version 0.2",date:"2023-04-18"},{title:K,date:L}=f;var O=c(`<h1>FAQ‚Äôs, Tahoogas, and Errors</h1> <h2>who!!</h2> <p>Now that I had my barebones website it‚Äôs not as difficult to map out what I want to do or where to start, so that‚Äôs a relief in a way.
