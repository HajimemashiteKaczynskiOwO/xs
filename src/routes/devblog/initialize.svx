# FAQ's, Tahoogas, and Errors
## who!!
Now that I had my barebones website it's not as difficult to map out what I want to do or where to start, so that's a relief in a way. I'm working on fixing the simple pages first, such as the About page and the FAQ page. Next after that will probably be the resources/security page, since thats not too bad either. Lastly I'm pretty sure im gonna do the clicker because thats gonna take the most work.
I've made aroud 2-5 backups ready incase something web-breaking occurs again, so im read.y....
## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the site:
* 1337XS now has a fixed About and FAQ page.
* Added Herobrine

To get a better view on the changes proposed in that first version it is easier to watch the tutorial, it gives you a much better insight into what I started with.

## Features
    ðŸ˜´ Not much.. yet..      

## Upcoming Changes & Additions
* Clicker game, Extras page, fixes.
* JinkyNews (no not kinkynews or ninkyjews) okay maybe itll be called TahoogaNews but something like that
